<b><i>Articifial Intelligence</b></i>, that's right, see you in 5 years when i finally understand how to even use it.

# Update
By some miracle, it didn't take 5 years... It actually just took 5 hours but uh hey, it works! My Tic Tac Toe game is now sentient, I guess. It even started doing my homework for me... <i style="font-family: san-serif">ko0l</i>.
